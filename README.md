# guess-the-number-game

Small game that I developped to practice the use of Spring and its various components.

techs included, but not limited to
* Spring Core
* Spring MVC
* Spring Boot
* Thymeleaf
    * Preprocessing 
    * SpEL
    * Dynamic templates
    * etc
* Extremely modular
* Maven
* etc (take a look at the various `pom.xml` inside the source folders)
